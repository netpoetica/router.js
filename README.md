router.js
=========

Simple Client Side Router for us in both Static (multiple HTML pages) and dynamic (templated via something like Handlebars) web apps.

This is generally useful for really small apps where you only need 1 JavaScript file and a bunch of simple JS handlers per route.

Run
```
make clean build
```
to generate a build when you're not using this as a component.
